### 👨🏻‍💻 About me:

Junior Frontend Developer with a solid background in JavaScript and hands-on experience building apps using React. I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Applied Computer Science and am passionate about developing intuitive user interfaces.

My technical toolkit includes JavaScript with a strong focus on React for building dynamic and responsive apps. I also have experience with version control systems like Git, which allows me to collaborate effectively in teams. Additionally, I am familiar with build tools like Webpack and Vite, which help streamline the development workflow and improve app performance.

I actively follow the latest trends in web development, constantly improving my skills in performance optimization, responsive design, and accessibility best practices. With a focus on user-centered design principles, I strive to create interfaces that are both functional and enjoyable to use.
